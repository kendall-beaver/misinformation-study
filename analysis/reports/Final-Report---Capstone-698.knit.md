# Intro

This capstone report assessed qualitative responses that were collected from 99 participants in Dr. Diana Daly's pilot study, "Design of audio ads to prebunk misinformation and promote civil discourse", where participants were asked the following qualitative questions ("QQ"):

-   [QQ1]{.underline}: What are some reasons you think people are attracted to radical groups?

-   [QQ2]{.underline}: What are some reasons you think people believe false ideas circulating online?

-   [QQ3]{.underline}: Describe a situation in which supporting friends would be more important than telling the truth.

These questions were asked before and after an ad was presented to a participant, which could be one of four ads: a control ad in an audio or visual-audio format, or a test ad in an audio or visual-audio format. The latter ad was the experimental ad that was designed to increase participants' information literacy and make them more skeptical about misinformation.

Each participant was also asked what they liked and disliked about their ad, plus any additional thoughts they had about said ad.

Thematic and content analysis was performed on the data to identify common themes. Each response was thoroughly and carefully reviewed several times, and if the meaning was still unclear then the response would be categorized as "Other". The category "Unsure" means that the participant specifically stated they were unsure and didn't have an answer to the question.

Additionally, a composite score was also developed to measure how much a person's thoughts increased or decreased based on a normalized count of words and sentences added or subtracted after listening to or viewing an advertisement.

Overall, the analysis found that the ad didn't necessarily change the responses to these qualitative questions, expect for very niche cases in QQ2, discussed in more detail in the report. The same conclusion can be made about the composite score, however there was unique insights when analyzing the data based on gender, how they had opposing views.

Additionally, if a different advertisement was presented to participants then the views may or may not change based on the emotional impact an ad may have. The themeatic analysis is also the views, as objective as possible, of just one person.

# Other Project

This didn't pan out. The link is here.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


``` r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
