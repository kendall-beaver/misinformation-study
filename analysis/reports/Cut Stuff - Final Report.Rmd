Even if the optimal amount of categories are identified and responses chosen for those categories, the ad may not have an impact on the responses unless a more direct message is conveyed through the dialogue. (If a different advertisement was presented to participants then the views may or may not change based on the emotional impact an ad may have.) Otherwise, the

Many of the limitations of the analysis have been discussed on those relevant sections. This section will focus on how these results can help future studies in collecting qualitative data. First, to easily quantify people's general beliefs about the QQs, a drop-down menu can be formed from the categories that have been identified here. To not overwhelm participants, the categories in QQ1 should be reduced from 9 categories to somewhere around 5 categories, which will align and be more uniform of the categories from QQs 2 & 3 that have 6 and 4 categories, respectively.

But it must be noted that unless an advertisement has a more direct message, then it may not influence people's responses to these types of QQs.

The github repo where this report and all accompanying data can be found is located at <https://github.com/kendall-beaver/misinformation-study>.

Additionally, if a different advertisement was presented to participants then the views may or may not change based on the emotional impact an ad may have. The thematic analysis is also the views, as objective as possible, of just one person.

This will be good to create categories for quicker analysis, especially if multiple studies want to be ran at once, and scaled up to occur more frequently. This pilot is a starting point, and additional comments can be left.

In summary, no correlation was found between the type of ad and categorical responses changing, although the composite score always increased whenever participants were show an audio-visual ad, whether a control or test ad. When the data was analyzed based on gender instead of ad group, there were slight contrasting views in how males and females answered a question, but overall, participants' views remained mostly unchanged before and after an ad.

Many themes were combined together that have some type of relationship and influence on one another. For example,

the categories in QQ1 have been combined that has some influence on each other. For example, with the largest category, 4 - Confirmation bias, people want to seek a community of like-minded people, "confirmation bias" means they're seeking people and sources that match their views. In other words, misinformation usually isn't objective and factual, but information that has been filtered subjectively or completely made up and seems real.

This question asked people their views on relationships, specifically how people form social bonds with radical people, therefore it's possible that many themes appeared to explain this complex, multi-faceted dynamic.

### PROPORTION (%), BY AD GROUP ###

# Step 1: Reshape, include GROUP, relabel columns
type_of_lie_long <- lying %>%
  select(GROUP, QQ1_CATEGORY_BEFORE, QQ1_CATEGORY_AFTER) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(QQ1_CATEGORY_BEFORE, QQ1_CATEGORY_AFTER),
               names_to = "QuestionType",
               values_to = "Response") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(QuestionType = recode(QuestionType,
                               QQ1_CATEGORY_BEFORE = "Before Ad",
                               QQ1_CATEGORY_AFTER = "After Ad")) %>%
  mutate(Response = str_split(Response, ";\\s*")) %>%
  unnest(Response) %>%
  mutate(Response = str_trim(Response))

# Step 2: Count and calculate percentages grouped by GROUP and QuestionType
lie_counts <- type_of_lie_long %>%
  group_by(GROUP, QuestionType, Response) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(GROUP, QuestionType) %>%
  mutate(perc = n / sum(n) * 100)  # Calculate percentage within each GROUP + QuestionType

# Step 3: Set factor levels for consistent x-axis order
lie_counts$QuestionType <- factor(lie_counts$QuestionType, levels = c("Before Ad", "After Ad"))

# Step 4: Create ONE plot, faceting by GROUP
plot <- ggplot(lie_counts, aes(x = QuestionType, y = perc, fill = Response)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack", color = "black") +
  
  # Internal labels for each part of the bar (show percentages)
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(perc, 1), "%")),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
            size = 3,

  labs(x = "\nResponses",
       y = "Percentage\n") +

# Step 5: Print the plot

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
