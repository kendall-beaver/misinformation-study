# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

Write from up to now. It was slow. (Simple and quick.) We recognized at an admin level that we need more evidence.

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 


### Number of hours: 
A quantity of hours, maybe towards specific tasks. 

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

### Date:

I set up my GitHub account this week and spent a lot of time entering metadata into the README files that explains all of the variables in Diana's study.

I want to compare my findings with Diana's findings, and possibly the demographic information to the main YouGov study.

I'm currently looking into the different types of lies. One interesting paper is...

Diana and I were supposed to meet on Thursday 4/3, from 10-11 am,  but have decided to push this back to next Wednesday 4/9, from 1-2 pm. 

I want to compare my findings with Diana's findings, and possibly the demographic information to the main YouGov study.

Week 14: 4/6 - 4/12

On Wednesday, 4/9, I met up with Diana and Kainan. 

I'm currently running GPT-2.
I went to try to update GPT-3. I received this error: "This repository was archived by the owner on Sep 19, 2020. It is now read-only."
I thought that maybe I couldn't use it, but I actually could. 

I'm running a Google Colab notebook for the first time. I need to acknowledge their code and figure out how to adjust
it for GPT-3. I ran into a problem where I need to pay to use an API key - actually, there's a free plan to test out the API key but 
I don't want to start that and find great results then have to pay to use that. Anyways, GPT-2 is completely free and open-sourced
so I'm just going to use that.

So I'm just running one pilot. 

I tried transcribing the audio with a free-open sourced software called Whisper, and it actually works, but I found out that I could just transcribe the audio myself much quicker than the program, but this will be useful for people who need to transcribe something else.

#### 4/13 - 4/19

One idea I had was to gather the time for audio podcasts and compare it to the category for skipping ads, assuming that participants will choose to skip ads for longer ones versus short ads. However, I couldn't find an easy way to gather the information so I abondoned that and instead chose to just count only one educational podcast in my chart.
